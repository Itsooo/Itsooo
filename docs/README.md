# Luau
Luau is a language that is made for Roblox in November 2021 that is derived from Lua 5.1 but has some cooler features, these features include: Ternary Operators (if a then b else c), Better compiler optimizations so code is runs a lot more efficiently even if you code doesn't include any sort of micro optimizations and lastly one of the big changes is that Luau is typed (not strict although you can set it optionally) unlike Lua which makes catching errors by the Linter a lot easer.

## Note
Some information to know before hand is that scripts run line by line ascending from 1 to infinity (or how many lines of code there are in your script)
